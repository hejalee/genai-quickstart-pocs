    "# Observability with LangFuse and Strands Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Strands Agents SDK, observability refers to your ability to measure system behavior and performance. Observability combines instrumentation, data collection, and analysis techniques. These techniques provide insights into an agent's behavior and performance, helping you effectively build, debug, and maintain agents that better serve your unique needs and reliably complete tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an agent with observability and evaluation capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) to process the Strands Agent traces and LLM as a judge to evaluate agent performance. The primary focus is on agent evaluation and the quality of responses generated by the agent using traces produced by the SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Observability and Evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observability** means being able to see what your AI agent is doing \"behind the scenes\" - like watching its thought process. It helps you understand why your agent makes certain decisions or gives particular responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation** is how we measure if our agent is doing a good job. Instead of just guessing if responses are good, we use specific metrics to score the agent's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observability Components\n",
    "\n",
    "All observability APIs are embedded directly within the Strands Agents SDK. The following are key observability data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Metrics**](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/observability-evaluation/metrics/) - Essential for understanding agent performance, optimizing behavior, and monitoring resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Traces**](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/observability-evaluation/traces/) - A fundamental component of the Strands SDK's observability framework, providing detailed insights into your agent's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Logs**](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/observability-evaluation/logs/) - Strands SDK uses Python's standard logging module to provide visibility into operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Evaluation**](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/observability-evaluation/evaluation/) - Essential for measuring agent performance, tracking improvements, and ensuring your agents meet quality standards. With Strands SDK, you can perform Manual Evaluation, Structured Testing, LLM Judge Evaluation, and Tool-Specific Evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenTelemetry Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands natively integrates with OpenTelemetry, an industry standard for distributed tracing. You can visualize and analyze traces using any OpenTelemetry-compatible tool. This integration provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compatibility with existing observability tools:** Send traces to platforms such as Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, AWS X-Ray, Datadog, and more\n",
    "- **Standardized attribute naming:** Uses OpenTelemetry semantic conventions\n",
    "- **Flexible export options:** Console output for development, OTLP endpoint for production\n",
    "- **Auto-instrumentation:** Trace creation is handled automatically when you turn on tracing"

    "### Use Case 1\n",
    "\n",
    " Evaluate how well an LLM can query a Knowledge Base containing 10k documents and provide financial analytical insights\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case we will be building a knowlegde base with 10k Documents from mulitple organisations. We will then test our LLM against pre-built test cases that have been created to determine how well it is retrieveing and generating responses to the questions answered. We will perofrm the following steps. \n",
