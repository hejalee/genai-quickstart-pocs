    "# Evaluating Bedrock LLM Solutions using AWS Strands, RAGAS and Langfuse \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an agent with observability and evaluation capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) to process the Strands Agent traces and LLM as a judge to evaluate agent performance. The primary focus is on agent evaluation and the quality of responses generated by the agent using traces produced by the SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Observability and Evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observability** means being able to see what your AI agent is doing \"behind the scenes\" - like watching its thought process. It helps you understand why your agent makes certain decisions or gives particular responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation** is how we measure if our agent is doing a good job. Instead of just guessing if responses are good, we use specific metrics to score the agent's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenTelemetry Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands natively integrates with OpenTelemetry, an industry standard for distributed tracing. You can visualize and analyze traces using any OpenTelemetry-compatible tool. This integration provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compatibility with existing observability tools:** Send traces to platforms such as Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, AWS X-Ray, Datadog, and more\n",
    "- **Standardized attribute naming:** Uses OpenTelemetry semantic conventions\n",
    "- **Flexible export options:** Console output for development, OTLP endpoint for production\n",
    "- **Auto-instrumentation:** Trace creation is handled automatically when you turn on tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we Evaluating?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Example we will be evaluating the knowledge base setup in notebook 01_Setup_S3_Vector_KnowledgeBase.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge base contains 10-k documents that have been added to an S3 Vector KnowledgeBase in Bedrock. We will build a test agent that will run through test scenarios in test_cases.json and try and extract usefull insights from the knowledgebase. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent will be configured to send all of its traces to langfuse. We will then pull these traces from Langfuse and evaluate them against metrics we have created using the RAGAS framework. We will then send these results back to langfuse where they can be reviewed and analysed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run Jupyter Notebook 01_Setup_S3_Vector_KnowledgeBase.ipynb and Copy the created Knowledge Base ID\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a langfuse account and project and copy the secret and public Keys. https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/get-started"

    "First, we need to install all the necessary packages for our notebook. Each package has a specific purpose:\n",

    "- **boto3**: AWS SDK for Python, used to access AWS services and Use Amazon Bedrock Models\n",
